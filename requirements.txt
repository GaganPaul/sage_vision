# Optional (quantization, large-models):
# bitsandbytes  # only if you plan to load large models with 8-bit quantization

# Notes:
# - On macOS Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4), install a PyTorch wheel with MPS support
#   following https://pytorch.org and ensure `torch.backends.mps.is_available()` is True.
# - Tkinter is part of Python's standard library (no pip package). On macOS you may need
#   to install tcl/tk (e.g., via Homebrew) if Tkinter is not available in your Python build.
